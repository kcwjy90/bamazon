WOW did you know that you can buy things online? I mean you probably did, but I bet you didn't know you can by using vscode.

This fun simulator let's the user decide which and how many items to buy using a simple command. 
First, the user is given a table of 10 products with it's price and stock number.

Then the user is asked two simple questions.
1. What do you want to buy?
2. How many do you want to buy?

The user can then refer to the table to pick an ID number for the item that they want to buy and can simply enter the number. 
After selecting what the desired item, the user can decide the quantity of their purchase.

If the user enters a number that is not listed, at the end of the second question, it will say "Invalid ID number" and the system will re-ask those questions again.
Similarly, if the user chooses more than what we currently have in our stock, it will say "Insufficient quantity", and likewise, will direct the user to answer both questions.


After picking the right item ID and quantity, the system will display how much the user has to pay for the purchased items.
Then the number of sold items will be deducted from the stock number and this will be reflected on the next round of purchase.
